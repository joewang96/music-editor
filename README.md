The Music Editor is a program which allows users to load, edit, and playback music which they create. The user can expand and rescale the window, as well as scrolling via the arrow keys as well as using the scrollbars. The user can jump to the start or end of the song, pause and resume whenever necessary, and even add or remove notes at whim!
